Priority:
1 - player attacks (projectiles, sword, etc.)
2 - collision / movement
3 - archetypes
4 - Event system
5 - loot

Better typescript types

Camera

    - [x] Add camera
    - [x] Move camera to Scene instead of Game - DO THIS!!!! - otherwise scene switching doesnt work
    - [x] Better camera setup - maybe have a deafult camera that get initialized when new scene is created - and then user can pass in custom values

Scene

    - [] maybe create a base scene that unless user creates his specific scene everything get rendered to
    - [] When switching scenes - clear the old scene - create teardown function for scenes (remove all entities etc.) - and the create regular scene switching without teardown

Prefabs

    - [] Decide on Prefabs - how to handle them, what the data should look like
    - [] Add Prefabs spawner

    each scene will have its own prefabManager
    first you will have JSON file with all the prefabs fro the specific scen
    this will load and create dictionary of prefabs
    so then you can just call scene.entityManager.createPrefab(prefabName) and it will create the entity with all the components

Map

    - [] Add tile map support (have both single image as background and tilemaps)
    - [] Add procedural generation for tile maps

AssetsManager

     - [] Add assets manager

Systems

    collision
        - [] Rework collision system - better resolution - maybe look into different collision detection

    movement
        - [] Rework movement system

    attack
        - [] Add attack system
        - [] Add enemy attacks

    upgrade
        - [] Add upgrade system

    loot
        - [] Add loot system
        - [] Drop loot from enemies

    inventory
        - [] Add inventory system
        - [] Add inventory ui

    enemy movement
        - [] Add enemy movement system - move enemies to the player position

    Event system
        - [] Add event system

[] Learn how delta time works / timestep etc. - !!!! NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS TO RENDERING AND SYSTEMS !!!!

    - [] BUG - when fps gets low sprite animations are not smooth
