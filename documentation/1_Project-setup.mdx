# 1.1 Setup frontend

I decided to use vite since the setup is super easy and it has a lot of great features like - HMR, super fast reloads and bundling etc. and a bunch more if i ever need them in the future.

To setup a new TypeScript Vite project i used the following command:

```bash
npx create-vite@latest
```

After that i named my project "frontend" and selected vanillaJS with TypeScript.

# 1.2 Setup backend

For my backed i decided to use Node.JS and TypeScript. I also decided to use expressjs for the backend since it is a very popular framework and it has a lot of great features like middlewares, routing, websockets etc.

To setup a new node project i used the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then i installed TypeScript:

```bash
npm i -D typescript
```

and created a tsconfig.json file with the following command:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

After that i created a src folder and a index.ts file inside it.

```bash
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

Then i installed express, nodemon, ts-node (allows live reload):

```bash
npm i express nodemon ts-node
```

since we are using typescript i also installed the typescript types for express:

```bash
npm i -D @types/express
```

Now my package.json dependencies look like this:

```json
 "devDependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^5.0.0",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.7",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.2",
    "typescript": "^5.6.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.21.0"
  }
```

I also added a script to my package.json to run nodemon:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts"
  }
```

And then finally i added nodemon.json file with the following content:

```json
{
  "execMap": {
    "ts": "ts-node"
  }
}
```

Now i can run the backend with live-reload using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
