# 2 Game maps

My goal is to have three maps in the game. Each with different theme. Player will start on the first map and after killing the boss a new map will be unlocked.

## 2.1 Creating the map

I decided to use Tiled for the map editor. It is a free and open source map editor that is very easy to use.

Since I want to focus on coding I went to itch.io and searched for free to use tilesets. I found one that I liked downloaded & imported it into Tiled.

Creating the map was pretty easy. First you need to create a new tileset to pick the tiles from.

{/* TODO: add image of tileset import */}

After that you can create a new project that will be your map. The tiles i downloaded was 16x16 pixels so i set the tile size to 16px.
My goal was to have a big map that takes some time to walk through so I set the width & height to 1600px (100x100 tiles).

{/* TODO: add image of map creation */}

After that you can start adding the tiles to the map.

{/* TODO: add image of adding tiles */}

I also created a second layer with trees and other objects.

{/* TODO: add image of adding objects */}

Then after you are done you can save the map. Tiled has this awesome feature where you can save the map as a JSON file. This will be handy for later when we want to add walls and collision.

I saved the map as a JSON file and a PNG file.

And thats it for the map creation. Now you have a map that you can use in your game. With all the important data in the generated JSON file.
