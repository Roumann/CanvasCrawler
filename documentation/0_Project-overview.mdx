# Setup project

This project will be a monorepo with two packages:

- frontend
- backend

## Frontend

- vite [vite.dev](https://vite.dev/)
- TypeScript [typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- css for styling

The frontend will be a typescript project bootstrapped with vite and no other dependencies.
The main goal of this project is to learn, so using prebuild game engines like phaser etc. is not a something i want to since they abstract a lot of the fun stuff away.
If we need some functionality we will build it from scratch.

## Backend

- node.js [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- TypeScript [typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- express [expressjs.com](https://expressjs.com/)
- websockets

This game will feature a multiplayer functionality. The backend will be a node.js project that will handle the websockets and the game logic.

## other

- Tiled [mapeditor.org](https://www.mapeditor.org/)

Tiled is the map editor we will use to create the maps for the game. At some point I might build a custom map editor but for now I will use Tiled.
